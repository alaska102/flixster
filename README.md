### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

This week was my first of ever using Javascript. Although both the Report Card and Giphy labs gave me the skills I needed to complete this project, I struggled a lot. Specifically, I think the stretch feature of creating the additional info popup boxes and the videos were really challenging to me. I also felt a bit unprepared when creating the movie grids, as I didn't have much CSS practice. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have improved the layout of the popup boxes. I definetly think I could have improved there with making the UI look more visually appealing. Additionally, I would have liked to add cursor effects. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I'm really proud of how the movie grid turned out. It's exactly what I envisioned when I made it, and it completely represents my personal style :) However, I struggled a lot with the backend work. Using Javascript & APIs for the first time was a significant challenge but it was really cool to explore. One thing my friend did was letting the videos play in fullscreen and I think that would be a really cool feature to try exploring, especially iframes.
